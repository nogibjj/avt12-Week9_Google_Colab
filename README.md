# avt12-Google Colab-Miniproject 9

In this project, while I forked over my first individual project, I have included a Google Colab link to run the Python script to prepare charts and tables separately. I include the link below. The data visualizations shown below reflect those rendered using Google Colab.

## **Data Source**

As per the previous assignment, I used the records from the recently concluded 2023-2024 NBA season. This data was made available at basketball-reference.com, and I attach the link to the data below. In total, there are records from 572 players tracked within this dataset. In my barcharts, I included data regarding assists in particular for the two visualizations.

## **Example Summary Output**

I include here a snapshot of the descriptive statistics, as applied to all variables present within the dataset.
